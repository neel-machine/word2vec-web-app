# word2vec-web-app

Using colab I have created a word2vec embedding binary file for Game Of Thrones text. Used the binary file in flask application to access the most similar words for a given query.

While creating the word2vec model it has been observed that more the text more the similar words are placed nearer in vector representation. Used pycharm and colab for the development. Some useful links for reference for creating a flask app and loading binary file

Future scope is to visualise the word embeddings and explore other libraries
